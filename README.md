# yelp_review_analysis

The project is going to detect fake reviews in yelp website. We got test data from  Prof.Shebuti Rayana, also scraped data from yelp website. Then we established different machine learning models to predict whether the review is fake or true. After comparing the performance, we chose SVM classfication model results as our prediction results. Based on the results data, we conducted different visulization methods and sentiment analysis to conclude unique features of fake and good reviews, to give consumers a broad pre-judgement when evaluating the restaurants using reviews.

The repo are consisted of three codes, including web scraping code "review scraping", machine learning code "ake review detection" and visualization code "fake review visulization". This is my first time to put up the codes of project. So, if there are any errors or problems, please kindly tell me.

Thank all of you for using or checking these codes.

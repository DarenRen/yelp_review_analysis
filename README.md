# Yelp Review Analysis

The project is going to detect fake reviews in yelp website. We got test data from Prof.Shebuti Rayana, also scraped data from yelp website. Then we established different machine learning models to predict whether the review is fake or true. After comparing the performance, we chose SVM classfication model results as our prediction response. Based on the prediction data, we conducted different visulization methods and sentiment analysis to conclude unique features of fake and good reviews, to give consumers a broad pre-judgement when evaluating the restaurants using reviews.

## Codes
